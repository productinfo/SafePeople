# SafePeople

SafePeople is an app geared toward individuals who are struggling with addiction, anxiety, depression, or just need a little help reaching out for support from their trusted people.

When an individual feels anxious, tempted, or in need of help, they can open the SafePeople app and simply press the "Safe" button and it prepare a text message to be sent to their trusted people. We know how difficult it can be to reach out when in need of help, so this is a attempt to try and help people get help when they need it!

Tech used: SwiftUI, CoreData, AppStorage
